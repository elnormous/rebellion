# Utilities for Star Wars: Rebellion board game

This repositories includes two utilities for the board game. You can test them here: http://elviss.lv/rebellion/

## Combat helper

Allows you to enter the units each faction has and calculates the dice you have to throw during a battle and what abilities your units have. When a unit is killed, just press the "-" button in the corresponding row and the die count and ability list will be updated immediately so that you don't have to do it every round of combat.

## Production helper

You can enter the loyalty (rebel, imperial, or subjugated) of each system (except for the Rebel Base and Coruscant) and whether they are sabotaged in this utility. The script will calculate the production for each faction immediately after any change in loyalty or sabotage is made. This utility can significantly reduce the time spent on calculation of production during the build step.
